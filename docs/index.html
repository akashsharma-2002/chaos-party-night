    <p>
      Chaos Party Night is a local, offline party game. No account is required.
      We store player names and settings locally on your device so groups can
      reuse the same setup. You can reset this data at any time using the in-app
      "New Party / Reset" button.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      The app itself does not collect personal information such as name, email,
      phone number, or location.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ads are provided by Google AdMob. AdMob may collect device identifiers
      (such as the Advertising ID), IP address, and basic device information to
      serve and measure ads. If you allow personalized ads, AdMob may use this
      information to show more relevant ads. If you choose "No thanks," the app
      will request non-personalized ads.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Local player names and settings are stored only on your device.</li>
      <li>Ad data is used to serve and measure ads and prevent fraud.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ads and Consent</h2>
    <p>
      Ads appear only on the post-game screen. We use Google User Messaging
      Platform (UMP) to show a consent form only if required by your region.
      On iOS, if you choose personalized ads, you may see the App Tracking
      Transparency (ATT) prompt.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell your personal data. Ad-related data is handled by Google
      AdMob as part of ad delivery and measurement.
    </p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>
      This app is intended for users 18+. We do not knowingly collect data from
      children.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>

      <li>Reset consent in Settings (Privacy & Ads).</li>
      <li>Clear local player data via "New Party / Reset".</li>
